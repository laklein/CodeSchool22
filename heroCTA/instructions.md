2. The hero section should be centered horizontally on the page with a height of 450px and a max-width of 1200px
3. Link to and use the free Google font "Roboto" for all text: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto (you will need the Light 300 & Bold 700 styles)
4. Do your best to guess colors, font-sizes, margins, and padding. Your build should match the mockup as closely as possible.
5. Be prepared to present your webpage and code to the class
